Introduction
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for web development and more. Understanding how JavaScript handles objects, scopes, and closures is crucial for building efficient and maintainable code.

JavaScript Objects
JavaScript objects are a fundamental data structure used to store and manipulate data. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key is a string (or Symbol) and each value can be any JavaScript data type. Here are some key concepts regarding objects:

Creating Objects: Objects can be created using object literals or constructors.
javascript
Copy code
// Object Literal
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };

// Using Constructors
function Car(make, model) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
}
const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Camry");
Accessing Object Properties: Object properties can be accessed using dot notation or bracket notation.
javascript
Copy code
console.log(person.name);  // John
console.log(myCar["make"]); // Toyota
Object Methods: Objects can contain functions as properties, known as methods.
javascript
Copy code
const calculator = {
  add: function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  subtract: function (a, b) {
    return a - b;
  },
};
console.log(calculator.add(5, 3)); // 8
Scopes
JavaScript uses a lexical scoping model, where variables are scoped based on their location in the source code. Understanding scopes is crucial for managing variable accessibility and avoiding naming conflicts.

Global Scope: Variables declared outside of any function are in the global scope and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

Local Scope: Variables declared inside a function are in the local scope and can only be accessed within that function.

javascript
Copy code
const globalVar = "I'm global";

function myFunction() {
  const localVar = "I'm local";
  console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
  console.log(localVar);  // Accessible
}

myFunction();
console.log(globalVar); // Accessible
console.log(localVar);  // ReferenceError: localVar is not defined
Closures
Closures occur when a function retains access to variables from its containing (enclosing) scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. They are powerful for data encapsulation and maintaining state.

javascript
Copy code
function outer() {
  const outerVar = "I'm from outer";
  
  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // Accessing outerVar from the enclosing scope
  }
  
  return inner;
}

const innerFunc = outer(); // outer() returns inner function
innerFunc(); // Executes inner function, logs "I'm from outer"
